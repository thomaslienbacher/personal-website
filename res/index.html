            <p>
                I am currently studying Computer Science at Graz University of Technology.
                In my spare time I enjoy programming and managing my digital infrastructure the most.
                This also reflects my part-time job as a software engineer.
                My main workstation is a Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 9 with an
                Intel i7-1165G7 and 32GB RAM. This is more RAM than I usually need, but it was the only model
                back then that would ship in less than 6 weeks.
                I have Fedora Workstation installed on it, because everything just works.
                I recently started tinkering with Void Linux and I must say <code>dnf</code> is much slower
                than <code>xbps</code>.
                On Friday evenings I usually spend my time at the maker- / hackerspace <a href="https://realraum.at">realraum</a>.

                And for good measure this website does not serve any JavaScript :-)
